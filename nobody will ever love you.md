# Nobody will ever love you

Malshapen face from inbreeding<br/>
Your puppy dog eyes are uncommonly wide<br/>
And nobody will ever love you more than I do now

Malshapen breast from breastfeeding<br/>
A wet nurse for cash and you blew your whole stash<br/>
Now nobody will ever love you more than I do now

I am leaving you<br/>
I am leaving you<br/>
But you'll stay<br/>

Malshapen heart from misleading<br/>
You lie and you lie and you barely get by<br/>
Now nobody will ever love you<br/>
Nobody will ever need you<br/>
Nobody will ever hold you<br/>
Nobody will ever feed you<br/>
More than I do now

You are beautiful<br/>
You are beautiful<br/>
You are mine
